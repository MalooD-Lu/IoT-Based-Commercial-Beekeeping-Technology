# 🐝 IoT-Based Beehive Monitoring for Efficient Honey Production 🍯

## 🌍 Overview

Beekeeping plays a vital role in agriculture, pollination, and honey production. Our IoT-based beehive monitoring system helps beekeepers track real-time hive conditions, optimizing honey yield while ensuring the health and safety of bee colonies. 📡🐝

## ❌ Problem Statement

Beekeepers face several challenges:

🏭 Bee Mortality Alerts – Sudden deaths due to environmental changes go unnoticed.

🏺 Honey Collection Timing – Lack of accurate monitoring results in inefficient harvesting.

📊 Bee Population Estimation – Keeping track of colony health is difficult.

🐻 Hive Security – Predators like bears threaten hives.

🌡 Temperature & Humidity Monitoring – Helps predict swarming activity.

🌬 Air Quality Tracking – Ensures a stress-free environment for bees.

## 🛠 Solution & Features

📡 1. Real-Time Monitoring

📈 Sensors track hive temperature, humidity, and sound levels.

🔔 Alerts notify beekeepers of unusual hive activity.

🚨 2. Bee Mortality Alerts

📊 Drastic changes in sound frequency indicate bee deaths.

🚨 Red alerts notify beekeepers for quick action.

🍯 3. Honey Collection Indication

📏 Sensors analyze hive weight to estimate honey storage.

⏳ Notifies beekeepers when it’s time to harvest.

🧮 4. Bee Population Estimation

🏠 Calculates colony size based on bee flight frequency.

🔢 Uses Arizona University’s formula to estimate bee numbers.

🐻 5. Hive Security & Predator Detection

🎥 Motion sensors detect intrusions (e.g., bears) and send alerts.

🚨 Beekeepers are notified to take immediate action.

🍽 6. Feeding Time Prediction

⚖ Monitors hive weight to determine when bees need supplementary feeding.

🍯 Suggests optimal sugar-water mix ratios for feeding.

🌡 7. Swarm Prediction & Air Quality Monitoring

📊 Temperature increase signals potential bee swarming.

🌬 Air quality sensors detect pollution affecting bee health.
